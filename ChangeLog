ITVal-0.4-r3: December 13, 2005 Robert Marmorstein
	 Fixed some memory access bugs that caused ITVal to crash when
	 the parser freed names already freed by the MDD query constrution
	 code.  Also changed the output of the "Ports" subject to be more
	 readable.  Fixed other minor problems.  ITVal now ignores
	 "MASQUERADE" and "REDIRECT" targets.  It used to NAT them to
	 127.0.0.1, which is not realistic.  (It had no topology file to work 
	 with at that point).  Now that we have the topology file, implementing 
	 realistic MASQ is on the TODO list and ITVal temporarily 
	 ignores these targets.
	 
ITVal-0.4-r2: December 13, 2005 Robert Marmorstein
    Fixed a bug in src/chains.cc and src/iface.cc that caused ITVal to
    crash when encountering a "strange" target like TCPMSS.
    
ITVal-0.4-r1: December 13, 2005 Robert Marmorstein
    Fixed a bug in Makefile.am that broke "make dist" so that .h files
    were not distributed with the package.

ITVal-0.4: November 9, 2005 Robert Marmorstein 
   Queries may now use the "INFACE" and "OUTFACE" operators to specify
   a network interface for incoming or outgoing connections.  These
   queries only make sense when using the verbose firewall input.

ITVal-0.4: November 8, 2005 Robert Marmorstein 
    Introduced several changes to the command line.  The -f command
    loads a "normal" filter file.  The -F command loads a verbose filter
    file.  Similarly, -n loads a normal NAT file, while -N loads a
    verbose NAT file.  I believe it is a bad idea to mix and match file
    types for a single firewall.  Firewalls specified with the -f and -n
    flags assume that every rule matches ALL interfaces.  To use -F and
    -N, a topology file MUST be specified.

ITVal-0.4: November 2, 2004 Robert Marmorstein 
    Changed the format of the command line options to allow reordering
    of the flags.   Multiple NAT files are now associated with the most
    recent filter file.  Topology files can be specified with the -t
    flag.

ITVal-0.4: November 1, 2005 Robert Marmorstein 
    Added support for topology files.  Each line of the topology file
    consists of a space seperated list of the form: 
    <interface> <ip address>

ITVal-0.4: November 1, 2005 Robert Marmorstein
    Migrated ITVal make system to use the GNU autoconf tools.

ITVal-0.3: August 5, 2005 Robert Marmorstein
    Primarily a bugfix release.  Some improvements to the printing
    system and some preparation for interface support.

ITVal-0.2: April 30, 2005 Robert Marmorstein
    Introduced several bugfixes, added support for NAT and for
    analysis of multiple serially connected firewalls.

ITVal-0.1: October 15, 2004 Robert Marmorstein
    Initial release of ITVal.  Support for simple queries on a single
    firewall.
