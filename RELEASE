Thank you for downloading Version 0.7 of ITVal, an iptables configuration
verification tool.  Version 0.7 contains some bug fixes and adds support for
address ranges both in queries and in group/service definitions.  Support for
the "CLASSES" query has been improved, but should still be considered beta.

Version 0.6 included many bug fixes and some features from version 0.5 (which
was not released) including some preliminary GUI support.

Version 0.5 introduced a new type of query called "CLASSES" that partitions the
set of all IP addresses into groups according to how the firewall treats each
host with that address.  It also introduces a few minor bugfixes.  

What's new in 0.5?
------------------

ITVal-0.5 provides a special new query.  The "CLASSES" query presents
a partitioning of the IP address space based on the filtering policy
of the firewall.  The basic idea behind this approach is that many
hosts will be treated the same by the firewall.  For instance,
internal clients in the same department are probably equivalent in
terms of the filtering policy.  On the other hand, special systems,
such as the mail server, will be treated very differently from other
hosts.  

The CLASSES query prints out a complete list of "classes" of systems.
Each class represents a group of hosts which the firewall treats
identically.  In other words, if one host in the class can access a
certain service through the firewall, so can ALL hosts in that class.

What is not provided in release 0.5?
------------------------------------
1.  Support for non-iptables filters.

ITVal does not filters for platforms other than Linux. Because maintaining
parsers for other languages is costly and time-consuming, it is unlikely
that I will be adding support for other platforms.  However, I do intend
to create an API for writing language modules, so if you want to see
your platform supported, you will have the tools to add support for that
language.

2.  Support for application level filtering.

ITVal is designed to work only with packet-filters.  While, in theory,
ITVal could be extended to other uses, such as e-mail filtering, to do
so would require a significant overhaul of the internal design.

3.  A fancy graphical front-end.

A preliminary front end is available in the source code and by running xITVal.
